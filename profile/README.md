## What is it?

Amaya is a lightweight and modular asynchronous web framework, delivered in parts in several jar packages.

## What can it do?

By default, any build of the framework created on the basis of the amaya-core-api should be able to handle user controllers, support configurability, log events that occur, and run an http server with the specified parameters.

## Advantages of the framework

This framework is designed not only taking into account the mistakes already made, but also with a fresh look at what some things should be.

<p>Main features:</p>

* Using "controllers" as the main interface for user interaction
